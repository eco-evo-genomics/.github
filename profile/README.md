Environmental change is exerting strong selection pressures on natural populations now more than ever. Fortunately, there is hope, given that examples exist of species adapting remarkably quickly with complex genetic and phenotypic changes within only a few generations. Understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms behind these examples of ‘high evolvability’ and to what extent they are present in other species will help us better forecast the effects of environmental change.

Topics that we intensively work on are:

- Generating new genomic and computational resources to study adaptation and signals of selection from genomes.
- Understanding the genetic architecture and evolutionary history of cases of rapid adaptation.
- Studying the importance of reusing pre-existing genetic variation for wild populations to adapt.
- Unraveling the fast evolution of genome structure and gene regulation.
- Understanding the interplay of developmental plasticity and genetic adaptation.

We work intensively with beetles (Pogonus chalceus) and ​​​​​​water fleas (Daphnia magna)
